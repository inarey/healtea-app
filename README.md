# 🍵 Healtea – Blended Japanese Wellness

**Healtea** is a fictional healthy tea brand project built as a full-stack portfolio case study during my 6-week developer bootcamp (aka “dev-cation”). The goal is to practice real-world full-stack development while building a clean, responsive, and scalable ecommerce-style web template that can also be reused or resold in freelance work.

## 🚀 Getting Started
## ⚠️ Tailwind v4 Issue

Originally tried Tailwind CSS v4, but faced version compatibility issues with PostCSS/Vite.  
→ Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3.4.1 for project stability.

Next steps: Consider updating to v4 later once stable + plugin support improves.
